#### Challenge 13
Write a method named multiBracketValidation that, given a string, returns true or false if that string has balanced brackets ie: (){[]} returns true but ({[)]} returns false.

#### Approach and Efficiency
The approach for this challenge was to use a stack to track every instance of an opening bracket found, as they will then need to be closed in a last-in first-out order. Whenever a closing bracket is found, the top value from the stack of opening brackets is popped to see what type of closing bracket should be expected. If a closing bracket does not match to what it should be, or the stack is not empty after iterating through the entire string, the method will return false. This method has a Big O time and space efficiency of O(n) due to the need of creating a stack to track all opening brackets and having to iterate over every character in the string.
