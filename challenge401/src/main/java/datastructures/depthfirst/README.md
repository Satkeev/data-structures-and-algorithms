#### Code Challenge 38
#### Depth First
This is the implementation of a pre-order traversal for a graph in Java

##### Challenge Description
Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

#### DepthFirst()
Will take in an array of node values and return true or false if there exists a path along with the sum of edge weights.

#### Approach & Efficiency
DepthFirst():
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n*e)
