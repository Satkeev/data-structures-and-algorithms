Code Challenge 3
Binary Search
This search algorithm code challenge is used to further our understanding of Java syntax as well as introduce us to the idea of time and space complexity.

Challenge Description
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist

Approach & Efficiency
Fairly simple approach.

Time: O(log(n))
Space: O(1)
